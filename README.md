## Note-taking

- Zettelkasten note-taking support using vim
  - My note (old date) using vim <https://github.com/thuanpham2311/garden>
  - [My note-taking setup (old date)](https://github.com/thuanpham2311/garden/blob/main/publish/20211017203814.md)
- Zen writing with my minimal theme by default, the better way you can use `gn` in zsh shell it will go to note dir and open vim with README.md (you can edit for your note path, what file you want to open by default)
- `[[` in insert mode: for linking the note with Ag search content in your note
- `ctrl+k` insert mode: create a link with your latest copy (required wl-copy, you also change clipboard you using)
- Select sth... in visual mode `Enter`: auto-link the new note with title = "# what you select"
  - E.g. select `Thuan Pham so cute` ⇾ [Thuan Pham so cute](yyyymmddhhmmss.md) ⇾ `# Thuan Pham so cute`
- `Enter`: go to the first note link in the right
